End-to-End ML Project: California Housing Price Prediction 

A complete Machine Learning pipeline to **predict median housing prices in California**, leveraging **Scikit-Learn**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and powerful ML models like Decision Trees and Random Forests.

Project Summary

This project demonstrates a full **end-to-end ML workflow**, including:

* ✅ **Data Collection** & Initial Exploration
* ✅ **Geospatial Visualization** of housing prices
* ✅ **Data Cleaning** – handling missing values & categorical features
* ✅ **Feature Engineering** & Transformation
* ✅ **Model Training** – Decision Tree, Random Forest
* ✅ **Model Evaluation** using metrics & visual tools
* ✅ **Model Tuning** via Cross-Validation



Dataset

The project uses the **California Housing Dataset**, built into `scikit-learn`.
 Key Features:

* 🗺️ `longitude`, `latitude`: Property location
* 👥 `population`: Total residents in the area
* 💰 `median_income`: Average income of the neighborhood
* 🏡 `median_house_value`: **Target variable** – housing price
* 📦 Additional variables like `housing_median_age` and `total_rooms`

 Goals

* Build a robust pipeline from **raw data** to **model deployment-ready output**
* Gain practical experience in **data preprocessing**, **visual analysis**, and **ML modeling**
* Compare baseline and optimized models using real-world data
